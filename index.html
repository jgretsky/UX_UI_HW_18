                 <h3 class="text_1"> Hello, I am Julia Gretsky, a freelance UX researcher and designer. 
                 I specialize in conducting usability testing, discovering and addressing humans wants and needs. 
                    I enjoy solving user problems that meet business requirements and drive the creation of a better product. 
                </h3>
            </div>
             <p class="text_2">
                Prior to UX Research and Design, I’ve worked in market research, marketing agencies, and consulting.
                I have always had a passion for understanding humans and how they interact with their environment. 
            </p>

            <p class="text_2"> 
                Different narratives and perspectives can improve experiences, products, services, and ultimately larger world problems.
                People inform design and in turn, design informs and influences people. My goal is to create design that will instill positive behavior and make a lasting impact on the world. 
            </p>

            <p class="text_2"> 
                When am I not learning about users a, you can find me decompressing with a quick workout, trying to recreate a recipe from one of the many food bloggers I love, or searching Brooklyn for the best latte. 
                So if you don’t have work for me, at least drop me a good recommendation!
